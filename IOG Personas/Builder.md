  Builders are the persona that selects the technology platform for a    new chain   . They are typically founders or have significant influence in the platform choice. While often technical, their motivations are focused more often on the outcomes they seek with a new network and the characteristics of the technology or network that are likely to lead to those outcomes.
We believe a builder selects a platform based on the ability for the platform to solve some of their largest problems in starting a new blockchain network. These are largely non-technical decisions:


     	 	
  Token listing
 . The majority of new blockchain networks aim to monetise through a new native token. However, it is very expensive ($5m+) and time consuming to get a listing for a new token on a CEX. 

    	 	
  Users
 . Gaining new users involves ensuring their wallet works with the new network and the new network has an easy path for them to move tokens. 

    	 	
  DApps
 . Networks require DApps to attract users for the utility the DApps provide. Generating a new ecosystem of DApps is very expensive and takes significant time. 

    	 	
  Liquidity
 . CEXs, DEXs, NFTs and other major use cases require sufficient liquidity for trades to have reasonable spreads, reduced slippage and other characteristics essential to a functioning DApp ecosystem. 

    	 	
  Interoperability
 . Networks cannot stand alone. Tokens and general messages must be able to be passed securely between chains to enable interoperability.
