# D App developers

  DApp developers publish DApp to various blockchains. They are distinguished from DApp Builders which represent the organisations the developers work in. Developers are not typically empowered to make choices over which platform they are developing for, DApp Store publishing or other items. This is the domain of the DApp Builder which makes the business decisions that are implemented by developers.

   PAIN POINT #1
   

  Ethereum Dapp developers find that running their Dapps on this chain has high GAS fees   

  The Cardano blockchain has lower GAS fees based on the way it was built   

  





       
            
            


    PAIN POINT #2
   

  Dapp developers want certifications that brings trust to their end-consumers and validation for their work   

  The three levels of certification provided by the DApp Store and 3rd party auditors will ensure correctness, compliance and consistency   

  





       
            
            


    PAIN POINT #3
   

  Does not want to learn another developer language (already knows Solidity) as it takes time and effort   

  Using Mamba EVM sidechain the DApp Store makes it easier to deploy on the Cardano blockchain using other languages   

  





       
            
            


    PAIN POINT #4
   

  Takes too long to research the best Ethereum wallet given the many choices   

  The DApp Store is build within a wallet which makes the process frictionless   

  





       
            
            


    PAIN POINT #5
   

  Dapp devs feel like their end-consumer lacks know-how of interaction with Dapps in general   

  The platform on which DApp Store is built provides educational resources
